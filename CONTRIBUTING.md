# Contributing to Awesome DMV Data & AI

First off, thank you so much for being part of the DMV tech ecosystem! This list exists to highlight the Data and AI work happening in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. 

To maintain a standard for the list, we manually audit every submission. Please read these guidelines before submitting a Pull Request.

---

## 📍 Geographic Requirement (The "DMV" Rule)
This is a **localized** list. To be included, the project must meet one of the following:

* **The Lead Developer(s)** are physically based in the DC, Maryland, or Virginia area.

* **The Company/Organization** is headquartered or has a significant engineering hub in the region.

* **The Project** was specifically built to serve a local DMV need (e.g., a DC-specific Open Data tool).

*Note: We may ask for a LinkedIn profile or university affiliation to verify local ties during the audit.*

## ✅ Quality Standards
We aren't just looking for "any" code. We look for projects that show professional intent:

1. **Public & Open Source:** The project must have an OSI-approved license (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.).

2. **The "README" Test:** Your repo must have a clear README explaining what the project does and how to run it.

3. **Activity:** The project should show recent activity (at least one commit in the last 12 months) or be a "stable" completed tool.

4. **Data/AI Focus:** The project must involve Data, Machine Learning, or AI Research.

## 🚀 How to Submit
1. **Search First:** Check if the project is already on the list.

2. **Fork & Edit:** Add your project to the most relevant category in alphabetical order. 

3. **Format:** Use the following format:
   `* [Project Name](URL) — A short, one-sentence description of what it does.`

4. **Open a PR:** In your Pull Request description, please briefly mention your connection to the DMV (e.g., "I'm a developer in Bethesda" or "This is a product of a GMU research lab").

## ⚖️ The Audit Process
I manually review every Pull Request.

* **If it's a "Yes":** I'll merge it and give you a shoutout! 

* **If it's a "Maybe":** I'll comment on the PR asking for more info (usually about the local connection or the license).

* **If it's a "No":** I'll explain why (e.g., it’s not Data/AI focused or it’s based in California). Don't take it personally—we're just keeping the niche tight!

**Thank you for helping us map out the future of AI in the DMV!**
